#Sentiment_Analysis_of_Pearl's_Tweets_Using_PowerBI

Sam Harris a modern intellectual and someone I highly respect. He left twitter in November this year, and described his leaving as a way to look better at society. Apparently he had resulted to blocking people enmasse and realzied his shape of the world and how he viewed people had changed due to his interaction on twitter. 
I then became interested in my imapct to the society on twitter.
I decided to scrape all my tweets since I joined twitter in June 2021 and palapate the temprance of my tweet using sentiment analysis.
